# Admin/Permission System Implementation Summary

I've successfully implemented a role-based access control system for your backend. Here's what was done:

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Model Updates
- Added `UserRole` enum with `User` and `Admin` variants (using lowercase in JSON: "user" and "admin")
- Added `role` field to the `User` model
- Updated `UserSession` to include the role field

### 2. JWT Token Enhancement
- Extended `Claims` structure to include user role
- Updated token generation to include role information (lowercase strings)
- Modified token validation to check for role field

### 3. Authentication Updates
- Updated signup to assign default `User` role to new users
- Modified signin to include role in JWT token
- Enhanced user_session endpoint to return role information
- Role values are now lowercase ("admin", "user") for consistency

### 4. Role-Based Middleware
- Created `RequireRole` middleware for protecting admin routes
- Fixed middleware ordering to ensure proper authentication flow
- Middleware checks user role against required role
- Allows admin users to access all protected routes

### 5. Role Management Functions
- Created RESTful endpoints for admin users to manage roles:
  - `GET /api/admin/users` - List all users with their roles
  - `PUT /api/admin/users/{id}/role` - Update a user's role
- Added necessary request/response models

### 6. Documentation
- Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/admin-permissions.md`
- Created API guide in `ADMIN_API_GUIDE.md`
- Removed unnecessary migration scripts in favor of API routes

## Frontend Integration

The frontend can now:

1. Store the role from the `UserSession` response:
```javascript
const session = await api.getUserSession();
localStorage.setItem('userRole', session.role); // Will be "admin" or "user"
```

2. Check if user is admin:
```javascript
const isAdmin = () => localStorage.getItem('userRole') === 'admin';
```

3. Conditionally render admin features:
```javascript
{isAdmin() && <AdminPanel />}
```

## API Usage

### List All Users
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/admin/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"
```

### Update User Role
```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/admin/users/{USER_ID}/role \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "role": "admin"
  }'
```

## Security Features

- All role checks are performed on the backend
- JWT tokens include role information
- Proper middleware ordering ensures authentication before role checking
- Default role is "user" for new signups
- Role values are lowercase for consistency

## Initial Setup

For the first admin user, manually update in MongoDB:
```javascript
db.Users.updateOne(
  { email: "admin@actota.com" },
  { $set: { role: "admin" } }
)
```

After that, use the API routes to manage other users' roles.

The system is now ready for production use. Admin users can manage other users' roles through RESTful API endpoints, and you can easily extend this to add more roles in the future.
